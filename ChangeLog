	* Altered the BIOS traps to be jumps to calls rather than calls. 
	 Mallard BASIC (and presumably other programs which assume the 
	 BIOS jumpblock is composed of JMP xxxx instructions) will now 
	 launch correctly.

	* zxcc-0.5.2 release.
	
	* Bug fix: BDOS function 10 now takes pointer to unsigned char, 
	 so that more than 128 bytes can be input (Andy Parkins).

	* Bug fixes: Add missing "break;"s to the big switch in zxbdos.c,
	 so that functions 0x1F and 0x2E return the correct values.

	* Implement functions 0x1F and 0x2E when compiling under Windows.

	* Compile fix: Ignore the return value of sync() in cpmredir.
